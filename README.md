## 📚 Topics of Interest
Here are some of the topics I'm particularly focusing on:

- Arrays & Strings
- Linked Lists
- STL
- Recursion
- BFS and DFS
- Sorting & Searching

## 🔧 How I Approach Problems
1. **Understand the Problem**: Read the problem statement carefully and identify input-output requirements.
2. **Choose a Strategy**: Decide on the best approach, such as brute force, divide-and-conquer, or dynamic programming.
3. **Code & Test**: Implement the solution in code and test with various edge cases.
4. **Optimize**: Review the solution to find any optimization opportunities.

## 💡 Lessons Learned
As I progress, I’ll note key lessons or strategies that I've learned along the way:

- The importance of choosing the right data structure.
- Optimizing recursive solutions with memoization.
- When to use BFS vs DFS in graph problems.
